## Introduction: A Programming Apporoach to Literacy Analysis
Very often people have difficulties understanding and approaching lyrics. That would lead to a less enjoyable experience in appreciating music, especially hip-hop music, such as rap. This project is an attempt to utilize digital tools to organise text data xxxxxx. 

This project aims to provide music lovers with approaches to rap music appreciation. It is suggested in our project that lyrics are a form of poetry. Thus, by analyzing rap lyrics as a poem, audiences might be able to get closer to the central theme of a song or understand how the lyrics might enhance the quality of a song.

There are three types of different categories considered in the project regarding different aspects of lyrics namely TEXT, SOUND, and IMAGERY. There are 5 types of attributes in TEXT, namely, metaphor, allusion, repetition, simile, and personification. 

In consideratoin of audiences without prior knowledge of programming, a more reabable programming language - XML is adopted. Hence, audiences could access to this project by following the instruction.  

## Data
The project include 40 Japanese rap songs found on Youtube as samples . Each of them last around 40 seconds. More information can be found in the source.csv file. They are managed in 



## Methodology

In this project, lyrics is regarded as a poetry for they have qualities in common such as writing styles. Poetc devices are the teniquees applied in writing to to enchance the playfulness and aesthetic of a text. Although the purposes of using poetic devices in rap lyrics might vary, they doubtlessly improve music lovers' experiences when listening. 

The first type of catergory is TEXT. There are mutliple approach poet can use to enchance the text. Metaphor and simile are two similar poetic devices both make comparison. The difference between them is the directness. Simile refers to A is like B, whether Metaphor indicates A is B. Secondly, allusion means to referecne an inforation absent in the content. Repetition, on the otherhand refers to the words or phrase repeated. 

The succeeding catergory is SOUND. Sound is a pratically important element in both sound and poetry. By repetition certain sounds, audience could receive a more enjoyable experience appreicating music. Assonance refers to the repetition of vowels sound. Alliteration means the repetition of inital consonant sounds. Likewise, cosonance also carries the meaning of consonant sounds repeition but at the middle or end of a word.

The last catergory IMAGERY. Imgaery is a common poetic device in poetry. It creates vivid imagary for audience, as if inviting them to praticing in the scene. Visual imagery refers to describing a scene precisely, so audiences could feel relatable. Auditory imagery means to describe sounds in details to create vividness.

## Discussion

Among 3 types of categories, doubtlessly, TEXT is of great significance, especially metaphor. 97 times of metaphor are recorded among 40 songs. The ways of using metaphor is diverse. For example, in the line 山をあがり谷をおりて後にみえる景色は from the song "All Gods Bless Me", metaphor is used to convey the idea of "roller coaster of emotions", whereas in some context, such as 静脈にレコード針 打ちます from "マジでハイ", metaphor is applied to convey the idea of taking intravenous drug vaguely. Besides, a similiar poetic device to Metaphor - simile is used for 10 times.

The less signifcant poetic device recorded in the TEXT category is personficaiton, which has only 11 times. Also, an interesting using of personficaiton is found in the song GIOTF. There is a line presumably about flexing wealth - Look my money dance, together with the use of visual imagery. There are two possible way to interpret this line: 

1. Watch (,) my money (is) dance(ing)
2. Watch my money dancing (using visual imagery to create a scene that money flies)

As for the Sound catergory,the use of consonance is recorded for 39 times. 

Lastly, the data of the Imagery group is out of expectance. The use of auditory is recorded for 8 times. It is argued that visual imagery is sailent in convey the hip-hop culture - flexing. For example, in the line 片手に札束飲み込むHennessy from the song "I'm"T"", it visualizes the image of the rapper holding banknotes and a luxurious alcohol - Hennessy. 

Furthermore, auditory imagery is slight different from onomatopoeia introduced ealirer. Auditory imagery could refer to a conversation, or a sound not conveyed through the onomatopoeia. For example, in the 人が聞いたら唖然としそう from the song "家庭の事情", 唖然 referring to an auditory imagery creates an image of silence. 

Hence, it is recommended that audiences focus on these aspects listed abovce when adapting our method in lyrics anaylsis.
