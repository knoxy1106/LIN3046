## Introduction: A Programming Apporoach to Literacy Analysis
Very often people have difficulties understanding and approaching lyrics. That would lead to a less enjoyable experience in appreciating music, especially hip-hop music, such as rap. This project is an attempt to utilize digital tools to organise text data xxxxxx. 

This project aims to provide music lovers with approaches to rap music appreciation. It is suggested in our project that lyrics are a form of poetry. Thus, by analyzing rap lyrics as a poem, audiences might be able to get closer to the central theme of a song or understand how the lyrics might enhance the quality of a song.

There are three types of different categories considered in the project regarding different aspects of lyrics namely TEXT, SOUND, and IMAGERY. There are 5 types of attributes in TEXT, namely, metaphor, allusion, repetition, simile, and personification. 

In consideratoin of audiences without prior knowledge of programming, a more reabable programming language - XML is adopted. Hence, audiences could access to this project by following the instruction.  

## Data
The project include 40 rap songs. Each of them last around 40 seconds.


## Methodology

## Discussion

Among 3 types of categories, doubtlessly, TEXT is of great significance, especially metaphor. 97 times of metaphor are recorded among 40 songs. The ways of using metaphor is diverse. For example, in the line 山をあがり谷をおりて後にみえる景色は from the song "All Gods Bless Me", metaphor is used to convey the idea of "roller coaster of emotions", whereas in some context, such as 静脈にレコード針 打ちます from "マジでハイ", metaphor is applied to convey the idea of taking intravenous drug vaguely. Besides, a similiar poetic device to Metaphor - simile is used for 10 times.

The less signifcant poetic device recorded in the TEXT category is personficaiton, which has only 11 times. Also, an interesting using of personficaiton is found in the song GIOTF. There is a line presumably about flexing wealth - Look my money dance, together with the use of visual imagery. There are two possible way to interpret this line: 

1. Watch (,) my money (is) dance(ing)
2. Watch my money dancing (using visual imagery to create a scene that money flies)

As for the Sound catergory, there are the use of consonance is recorded for 39 times. 

Lastly, the data of the Imagery group is out of expectance. The use of visual imagery is recorded for
