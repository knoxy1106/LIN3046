## Introduction: A Programming Apporoach to Literacy Analysis
Very often people have difficulties understanding and approaching lyrics. That would lead to a less enjoyable 
experience in appreciating music, especially hip-hop music, such as rap. This project is an attempt to utilize digital tools to 
organise text data xxxxxx. 

This project aims to provide music lovers with approaches to rap music appreciation. It is suggested in our project
that lyrics are a form of poetry. Thus, by analyzing rap lyrics as a poem, audiences might be able to get closer to
the central theme of a song or understand how the lyrics might enhance the quality of a song.

There are three types of different catergpries considered in the project regarding different aspects of lyrics namely TEXT, SOUND, and IMAGERY. There are 5 types of attributes in TEXT, namely, metaphor, allusion, repetition, simile, and personification. 



In consideratoin of audiences without prior knowledge of programming, a more reabable programming language - XML is adopted. Hence, audiences could access to this project by following the instruction.
