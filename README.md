## Introduction: A Programming Apporoach to Literacy Analysis
Very often people have difficulties understanding and approaching lyrics. That would lead to a less enjoyable experience in appreciating music, especially hip-hop music, such as rap. This project is an attempt to utilize digital tools to organise text data and provide music lovers approach to appreciating music. By marking the frequency of poeticise used in the lyrics, the tendency of using certain types of poetic devices might be found. Thus, audiences could follow the tendency if they feel bewildered understanding the lyrics.

This project aims to provide music lovers with approaches to rap music appreciation. It is suggested in our project that lyrics are a form of poetry. Thus, by analyzing rap lyrics as a poem, audiences might be able to get closer to the central theme of a song or understand how the lyrics might enhance the quality of a song.

There are three types of different categories considered in the project regarding different aspects of lyrics namely TEXT, SOUND, and IMAGERY. There are 5 types of attributes in TEXT, namely, metaphor, allusion, repetition, simile, and personification. 

In consideration of audiences without prior knowledge of programming, a more readable programming language - XML is adopted. Hence, audiences could access this project by following the instruction. 

## Data
This project includes 40 Japanese rap songs found on Youtube as samples. Each of them last around 40 seconds. More information can be found in the source.csv file. They are managed in the following pattern: Song title, Rapper, Part Retrieved, and Link.

Among the 3 types of categories, namely, TEXT, SOUND, and IMAGERY, TEXT is the most prominent. The penultimately significant type of the SOUND is out of our prediction. As it is assumed that SOUND-related poetic devices will be widely used in lyrics to create rhymes and musical effects. The use of auditory imagery has also come to our surprise, as it is similar to the SOUND category.

TEXT related poetic devices:
metaphors 97 times,
allusion 15 times,
repetition 34 times,
simile 10 times,
personification 11 times

SOUNS related poetic devices:
alliteration 113 times,
assonance 35 times,
consonance 39 times,
onomatopoeia 12 times

IMAGERY related poetic devices:
visual 94 times,
auditory 8 times

## Methodology

In this project, lyrics are regarded as poetry for they have qualities in common such as writing styles. Poetic devices are the techniques applied in writing to enhance the playfulness and aesthetic of a text. Although the purposes of using poetic devices in rap lyrics might vary, they doubtlessly improve music lovers' experiences when listening. 

The first type of category is TEXT. There are multiple approaches a poet can use to enhance the text. Metaphor and simile are two similar poetic devices both make comparisons. The difference between them is the directness. Simile refers to A being like B, whether Metaphor indicates A is B. Secondly, allusion means to reference a piece of information absent in the content. Repetition, on the other hand, refers to the words or phrases repeated. 

The succeeding category is SOUND. Sound is a practically important element in both sound and poetry. By repeating certain sounds, the audience could receive a more enjoyable experience appreciating music. Assonance refers to the repetition of vowels sound. Alliteration means the repetition of initial consonant sounds. Likewise, consonance also carries the meaning of consonant sound repetition but at the middle or end of a word.

The last category is IMAGERY. Imagery is a common poetic device in poetry. It creates vivid imagery for the audience as if inviting them to participate in the scene. Visual imagery refers to describing a scene precisely, so audiences could feel relatable. Auditory imagery means to describe sounds in detail to create vividness.

## Discussion

Among 3 types of categories, doubtlessly, TEXT is of great significance, especially metaphor. 97 times of metaphor are recorded among 40 songs. The ways of using metaphor is diverse. For example, in the line 山をあがり谷をおりて後にみえる景色は from the song "All Gods Bless Me", metaphor is used to convey the idea of "roller coaster of emotions", whereas in some context, such as 静脈にレコード針 打ちます from "マジでハイ", metaphor is applied to convey the idea of taking intravenous drug vaguely. Besides, a similiar poetic device to Metaphor - simile is used for 10 times.

The less signifcant poetic device recorded in the TEXT category is personficaiton, which has only 11 times. Also, an interesting using of personficaiton is found in the song GIOTF. There is a line presumably about flexing wealth - Look my money dance, together with the use of visual imagery. There are two possible way to interpret this line: 

1. Watch (,) my money (is) dance(ing)
2. Watch my money dancing (using visual imagery to create a scene that money flies)

In general, (2) might be more acceptable. However, dropping the linking verb - be is also common in hip-hop music. Thus, both ways of interpreting this line are adapted in this project. They might both function in indicating how affluent the rapper is. 


As for the SOUND catergory,the use of consonance is recorded for 39 times. An example of consonace is the line "何も無かったあの頃は幸せだったな" from the song "Lisa". In 何も無かったあの頃は幸せだったな (nani mo na katta ano koro ha siawase dattana), the a sound keeps repeating to create the rhythm. Likewise, the frequency of other SOUND-related poetic devices is of similar times. The use of assonance and alliteration is 35 times and 37 times respectively. It is assumed that SOUND related poetic devices are important in creating musicality and therefore they weigh equally among 40 songs. Onomatopoeia appears for 12 times, there will be a brief discussionon this part in the coming session.


Lastly, the data of the IMAGERY group is out of expectance. The use of auditory is recorded 8 times. It is argued that visual imagery is salient in conveying the hip-hop culture - flexing. For example, in the line 片手に札束飲み込むHennessy from the song "I'm"T", it visualizes the image of the rapper holding banknotes and luxurious alcohol - Hennessy. By describing a scene in details, audience could feel relatable to the idea. 

Furthermore, auditory imagery is slightly different from onomatopoeia introduced earlier. Auditory imagery could refer to a conversation, or a sound not conveyed through the onomatopoeia. For example, in the 人が聞いたら唖然としそう from the song "家庭の事情", 唖然 referring to auditory imagery creates an image of silence. Silence is a form of sound always being eliminated, this line utilizes auditory imagery to contribute silence skillfully. 


Hence, it is recommended that audiences focus on these aspects listed above when adapting our method in lyrics analysis.
